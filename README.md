## Purpose of Project

When thinking about the vast amount of data Plotly can represent, you do not normally think of using belly button bacteria. However, what is represented from the GitHub Page I created is just that, samples of bacteria from many individual samples. Using Plotly and Javascript, the bacteria is able to be selected from a dropdown list and several visualizations are created.
